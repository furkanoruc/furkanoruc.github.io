There is lots and lots of free parking in my neighborhood.</td><td>House Rule footnotes: 1.\tI don’t allow check in before 9:00 on the first day of your reservation. I offer ‘early arrival’ from 9:01 to 18:59 for $20 per group of people that arrive together. The ‘early arrival’ fee is triggered by the following behavior: arriving during the early arrival time frame, scheduling an arrival during the early arrival time frame, asking if you may arrive during the early arrival time frame or hinting that you will or want to arrive during the early arrival time frame. Each scenario consumes my time, thus the charge. Since even asking if you can arrive early costs money, please don’t ask. I always allow early arrival for a fee, so please just tell me when you will arrive during the early arrival time frame. Late arrival is from 21:00 to 23:59 and the price and terms are the same as early arrival. This means you should not ask if you can arrive late, because I always allow it for a fee. If you simply ask, that triggers the fee, because asking consumes my time </td><td>Public transit service to my house is outstanding. The 36 MUNI bus stops at my front door.</td><td>During the hours of 7:00 to 22:00, your access to the living room, dining area and kitchen is conditioned on you overlooking any dirt, messiness or untidiness you discover. The living room, dining area and living room are closed from 22:00 to 7:00. I am not required to share the public areas of my home, and can easily uncheck the access boxes inside Airbnb's software that permit access. I clean the public areas nearly constantly and I really try to keep the place clean, but keeping up with thousands of guests is challenging. This policy means you may never leave a review that complains about the public areas of my house being dirty, because if you do then you are admitting you failed to uphold your end of our agreement which is for you to overlook any mess or disarray in the public areas. At best, I will vacuum the common areas one time per day, so you will see dust balls and dog hair here, as I have an active dog playing with guests and my family for hours daily. Stay somewhere less b</td><td>I live at the house in my own bedroom, and I work from home, so I am around to answer questions and help you make the most of your visit. When you arrive, I will offer you a free map of San Francisco. I will also suggest we sit at the dining room table to discuss what you want to do while in the City. I will point out on the map the places you mention. I will also suggest other places you may not have heard of or considered.  Many of my guests later write in their reviews how much value they obtained from this conversation. Lots of hosts on airbnb don't spend the time to help their guests make the most of their visit. I love helping out my guests, and you'll sense my enthusiasm when we meet. I love San Francisco and I'll help you love San Francisco too. I am not like the concierge at a fancy hotel. I don't collect commissions from any of the places I recommend.</td><td>Airbnb has no default house rules that hosts can use. Every host must write their own rules. A host without rules can’t enforce any common sense on guests, because Airbnb requires there be a written rule to enforce. Why should you care? Imagine you book a room at a shared house and a guest gets roaring drunk and starts screaming. Unless there is a house rule prohibiting that, Airbnb will allow it to continue, and the host is powerless to require the guest to quiet down or depart. Since my rules are long, I have summarized them up front, and then elaborated in the footnotes. To understand all of the rules, you’ll have to read the summary and the footnotes. To get the general idea, you only need to read the summary. Please don't let them intimidate you, because it's these rules that allow me to ensure my guests will have a great experience at my busy shared home.

It's peaceful, and we try to stay reasonably quiet until guests awake, but if you seek complete tranquility, then our home might not be the right fit. That said, only about 1% of our hundreds of previous guests have mentioned noise as an issue.  We like to know a bit about our guests, so please complete your Airbnb Profile before you book.  We need to be home to greet our guests in person, and cannot always accommodate late arrivals. If you plan to arrive later than 10:00 PM, please ask BEFORE booking.

Everywhere!  Our neighborhood is great for bicycling: Flat, with dedicated bike lanes on both Valencia Street and 17th Street. And we're both avid riders, and love to share the city's cycling secrets. (Trust us: You want to know about the Wiggle before you set off to Golden Gate Park.)  The 101 and 280 freeways are also nearby, but parking in our neighborhood is tough. (The Mission-Bartlett Parking Garage is three blocks away, ~$30/day.)</td><td>You'll have your own bedroom and private bathroom, as well as shared access to our living room and sunporch. In the kitchen, you are free to store food in the refrigerator, use the microwave, and make light \"snacks,\" but please don't plan to use the stove, pots, pans, or knives. (With all the world-class restaurants nearby, who wants to cook?) We do not have parking available, but the \"Mission/Bartlett Parking Garage\" is nearby.</td><td>We are experienced Airbnb hosts, and have had 100's of guests before you. We'll happily point you toward the traditional tourist sites or the hidden hotspots, whatever your preference.  Guest interaction covers the full range, from sharing dinner or drinks, to rarely seeing each other. It all depends on preferences and schedules. If we are away during your stay, we will have a friend staying here to Host you.  We occasionally host guests in another room in our home.</td><td>PLEASE READ: By booking, you agree to all of the following rules. If there are too many rules for you to read through, please consider another listing! (These rules have evolved over our 10+ years of hosting on Airbnb, and they are here to make you aware of situations or issues that you might not like, and to keep you from booking a spot you may not enjoy.) CHECK-IN: You do NOT have a check-in time yet. YOU MUST COORDINATE YOUR CHECK-IN WITH US! After booking, please SEND A MESSAGE WITH YOUR ARRIVAL TIME. That way, we can try to coordinate your check-in time as best we can. (We do not have a lock-box, so we must be here to meet you in person for check in. We will try to accommodate your preferred arrival time. The sooner you schedule your arrival time with us, the more likely it will be that we can accommodate your timing, but you do not have a guaranteed arrival time until you have coordinated it with us.)

This San Francisco vacation rental is located in the heart of Hayes Valley. Unlike some other parts of San Francisco, Hayes Valley has managed to retain a sense of community and a nonexclusive feel despite the fast build-up and high price tags. Some of the businesses that braved the less-than-savory days are still around, such as the Hayes Street Grill, now twice its original size. But many of the shops sprouted up in the '90s, making Hayes Valley a real destination spot. The combination results in a wide diversity in clientele. While high-end San Franciscans sip $7 cocktails at Absinthe, down the street many are powering down an entire meal for around the same price at Flipper's. Now, tourists also head here specifically for the shopping, for one-of-a-kinds like a buffalo-leather chair or an exclusive Sue Wong Art Deco gown.

See photos of them in the photo section of our listing.</td><td>SAN FRANCISCO TIPS: --Bring a jacket, no matter what time of year you are visiting. It always cools down at night here, and can also be breezy. A leather jacket is perfect! --We recommend using the car services Uber and Lyft. They are much less expensive than taxis and more efficient than public transportation. We can give you codes for discounts.  --You might consider renting a car for at least part of your stay in San Francisco. Our neighborhood is well-served by mass transit, but some of the worthwhile attractions (such as the deYoung Museum) are far from the downtown, Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf areas. You might also want to take a day-trip up to the Wine Country or Muir Woods (parking reservation required), which are north of the city. --If you are parking a car in San Francisco, always turn the wheels so the car can't roll on a hill. If the car is pointed UPHILL, turn the wheels AWAY from the curb. If the car is pointed DOWNHILL, turn the wheels TOWARD the curb. --If you a</td><td>We are served by 2 bus lines and 1 tram line.

The \"T\" tram is about a 10-minute walk from our house, and it goes downtown, to the baseball stadium, to the waterfront, and connects with other transportation that will take you anywhere in the city, including Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. The #22 bus and the \"T\" tram also connect with the BART transportation system, which goes to the airport. By taxi, our house is about 15 minutes from the San Francisco Airport. Lyft or Uber is also an excellent option for getting around town and our recommended way to get here from the airport. If you aren't a member of these car services, we can provide you with a coupon code for a discount on your first ride. Just ask!

With neighbors directly above, right and left, you might hear footsteps, dogs barking, babies crying, any manner of \"city\" and/or \"roommate\" noise. It's peaceful, and we try to stay reasonably quiet until guests awake, but if you seek complete tranquility, then our home might not be the right fit. That said, only about 1% of our hundreds of previous guests have mentioned noise as an issue.  We like to know a bit about our guests, so please complete your Airbnb Profile before attempting to book.  If you plan to arrive later than 10:00 PM, please let us know BEFORE booking. If you book first, and then tell us about your late arrival, we'll request a $50 Late Check In Fee.  Please check your total price before booking. Our pricing varies, and can be higher on weekends and during \"high\" season, and there's also a cleaning fee, and a sur-charge for extra guests.  We do not offer discounts for long</td><td>It's an easy and lovely 10 minute stroll to the 16th St/Mission BART Station, and there are Muni Routes all around us, so there's easy access to SFO, Union Square, Moscone Center, Market Street, the Ferry Building, Golden Gate Park, AT&T Park... Everywhere!  Our neighborhood is great for bicycling, too: Flat, with dedicated bike lanes on both Valencia Street and 17th Street. And we're both avid riders, and love to share the city's cycling secrets. (Trust us: You want to know about the Wiggle before you set off to Golden Gate Park.)  The 101 and 280 freeways are also nearby, but parking in our neighborhood is tough. (There is a parking garage three blocks away, ~$25/day.)</td><td>Guests have their own suite, with a large bedroom / sitting area, \"en-suite\" bathroom, and exclusive use of the garden. Access to the suite is through the house, and down a flight of stairs. The stairs are old, steep, and narrow. Please take a look at the photos in our listing, and make sure the stairs won't be any trouble.  You will most likely be sharing the \"Common\" areas in our home with a \"Guest Host\" who'll be filling in for Wendy and I, and there may also be another room of Airbnb guests, too. Common areas include the living room and sunporch, as well as the kitchen, which may be used for storing and re-heating food and making light \"snacks\" but not for cooking full meals. Please, no real cooking without prior permission. (With all the amazing restaurants nearby, who wants to cook???)</td><td>This is usually our own bedroom, so if it's available, it might be because we're away. If we are both away, you will be sharing our home with a \"Guest Host\" - someone who'll be around to ensure your comfort, and to happily point you toward the traditional tourist sites or the hidden hotspots, whatever your preference. There may also be another room of Airbnb Guests, upstairs, in our Mission Sunshine listing. Guest interaction covers the full range, from sharing dinner or drinks, to rarely seeing each other. It all depends on preferences and schedules.</td><td>PLEASE READ: By booking, you agree to all of the following rules. If there are too many rules for you to read through, please consider another listing! (These rules have evolved over our 10+ years of hosting on Airbnb, and they are here to make you aware of situations or issues that you might not like, and to keep you from booking a spot you may not enjoy.) CHECK-IN: You do NOT have a check-in time yet. YOU MUST COORDINATE YOUR CHECK-IN WITH US! After booking, please SEND A MESSAGE WITH YOUR ARRIVAL TIME. That way, we can try to coordinate your check-in time as best we can. (We do not have a lock-box, so we must be here to meet you in person for check in. We will try to accommodate your preferred arrival time. The sooner you schedule your arrival time with us, the more likely it will be that we can accommodate your timing, but you do not have a guaranteed arrival time until you have coordinated it with us.)

We are in the city, so city life happens. The rental has double glazed windows and insulated walls to cut down on noise, and it does help. Noise tolerance is very personal and highly subjective to the individual’s comfort zone. Most of our guests do not have a problem with street noise, even babies and toddlers have slept soundly throughout the night! If you are a very light sleeper or highly sensitive to any noise, then this is not the right place for you. 2. Why do you charge an extra $80 cleaning fee? The cleaning fee is a one-time charge to clean the rental after you check out. It is a fair market rate by San Francisco standard. We take pride in delivering a clean, sanitized and comfortable space to every guest staying with us. We don’t scrimp on quality; you get what you pay for. 3. Why do I need to sign a rental agreement with you?

(This definition includes the entire Lower Haight within Hayes Valley.)   A mixture of restaurants, small nightclubs, cafes, drinking establishments, residences, galleries, and hair salons characterizes Hayes Valley who has a population of Total5,672 and Lower Haight Population Total9,120</td><td>Rental Cars and Parking Most locals and frequent visitors to San Francisco (SF) would recommend against renting a car or getting to SF using their own car.  This is because parking in the city is expensive and at times, hard to find.  Overnight parking in the city may cost a visitor $30 to $50 per night and in some cases without in/out privileges.  Parking near most of the tourist areas, may cost the visitor about $12 to $15 dollars an hour in a parking lot.   Parking spots along the road are hard to find and if one does, they are all metered every day of the week in the visitor areas. Parking outside the visitor areas is timed for visitors who do not have a parking permit.  And a parking ticket in San Francisco starts at $86 for the fine. Even if one finds an empty parking spot, visitors have to check to see if parking is allowed at that time.  There are street cleaning times, rush hour periods when parking is not allowed. Parking fines/tickets or the car being towed is the last thing</td><td>The area is served by several San Francisco Municipal Railway (MUNI) bus lines and it is a few blocks away from all of the MUNI Metro lines. The heart of the neighborhood, at the corner of Fillmore and Haight, is six blocks away from the subway stop of Church and Market, which is also the location of the city's largest supermarket, a Safeway. Surveys show that this neighborhood has one of the highest number of daily trips by bike per capita of any San Francisco neighborhood[citation needed], and walking is also very popular. The geography of the Lower Haight lends itself to the most efficient bicycle routing from the Mission District towards Golden Gate Park and surrounding neighborhoods, and the popular bicycle route termed The Wiggle zig zags through this neighborhood.</td><td>Living Room, TV Room, Kitchen, Laundry, Outdoor Patio</td><td>As the flat has 3 guests staying on property most everyone gets to know each other but still has their own privacy.</td><td>Over the past few years we have hosted more than 1000 guests into our Page Street Home.

However, you can check-in as LATE as you want, or check out as EARLY as you want ... because we have a spiffy electronic key pad entry system!  Yay for technology!   We e-mail you the key code before your arrival ... we pick a unique code for each guest, and we delete the code after you leave.  When you get here, it doesn't matter how late ... 2 A.M., no problem!  You can let yourself in and start getting settled in, or crash on the comfy bed, or even make some coffee and stay up all night watching DVDs, we don't care!  The point is, you have independent access and can come and go whenever you want.  Just be sure to arrive after 3:00 p.m. on your check-in and date, and depart prior to 10 a.m. on your check-out day.

A complete list of house rules will need to be agreed to prior to move in. 1.   STUDENTS ONLY - This home is intended for short term accommodation for visiting students only.   You must maintain your student, intern or educational work exchange status to stay here. 2.  FRIENDLY COMMUNITY - You should always be friendly & respectful to others, the house and the neighborhood.   Even if you perceive someone is not being respectful to you.   3.

We are located one block over from the famous San Francisco Chinatown, one block from the bustling Financial District, a few blocks south of \"Little Italy\" in North Beach, and just a 10 minute stroll from the water along the Embarcadero.</td><td>Our dorms hold between 6 and 8 people. \"Four\" refers to our maximum group size, not the dorm size. As a traveler's hostel, we welcome those coming to/from San Francisco as temporary tourists. We unfortunately are unable to host residents of the Bay Area.  DATES NOT AVAILABLE? Check one of our other listings!  MORE GUESTS IN YOUR GROUP? Our other listings can accommodate more guests!  We have multiple listings on Airbnb for the same hostel simply so that we may accept more than one guest at a time.  Search \"Friendly Hostel with Community\" to find them.  All of our \"Friendly Hostel with Community\" listings are for Pacific Tradewinds Hostel and are exactly the same (same hostel, same price, same rooms, etc).   Please note that occasionally the Airbnb calendar will show space is available when it is not, due to our calendars not aligning. You can always message us first to ask.</td><td>Public transportation is plentiful and nearby, though many things are walking distance. We are next to the #1 bus, 1 block from the California Cable Car line, and 5 blocks from the Montgomery BART station. You can catch many other buses near the BART station as well.  Cars are not recommended since we are right in downtown SF and parking garages are very expensive (about $30/24 hours). There is minimal street parking in front of the hostel: 7pm-7am during the week, and limited on the weekends. Alternatively, we know of some first come, first served free street parking across the city. You can then take a 25 minute bus ride back.</td><td>Guests have 24/7 access to their dorm, the shared bathrooms, the kitchen, and the common area. Please no cooking between midnight and 6am.</td><td>Reception is available to answer any and all questions between 8am and midnight. Reception is closed from midnight to 8am, though there is always some on site in case of emergency.</td><td>Check in is available from 8am-midnight each day.  Check out must be by 11am, the day of departure.   As a travelers house, all guests are required to have a government issued photo ID and proof of traveling status (i.e. plane tickets or passport).   You will be asked for a $20 refundable security deposit at check-in.    Most of our rules are common sense and will be explained at check-in.   In general, we simply ask that guests follow the golden rule of living in community:  \"Be Excellent to One Another\".

We offer mixed gender dorms, clean bathrooms, fully stocked kitchen, and a common room full of new friends in downtown SF. Come join us! Welcome to the smallest of the San Francisco hostels! We may be little, but we’ve got huge personality. Our space is all about creating community with fascinating travelers from around the world. Looking for instant friendships and awesome vibes? You found us, high five! We believe hostels are far more than just a cheap place to stay, and we are seeking out guests who feel the same.  Our accommodation is all mixed gender dorm rooms with 6 or 8 beds per room, bunk bed style, with large lockers underneath each bed. We also have a fully stocked kitchen, clean bathrooms, and c</td><td>none</td><td>Our location can't be beat! We are located one block over from the famous San Francisco Chinatown, one block from the bustling Financial District, a few blocks south of \"Little Italy\" in North Beach, and just a 10 minute stroll from the water along the Embarcadero.</td><td>Because we are a small hostel with a small staff, our reception is only open from 08:00 until 00:00. We understand that planes, etc. can get delayed. If you realize that you will be arriving after midnight, you MUST contact us by telephone by 5pm to see if we have someone to let you in after midnight. If we can accommodate your late arrival, there will be a $15 late check-in fee applied. Please note that even if you do call by 5pm, we CAN NOT guarantee that we will be able to accommodate the late check in.  As a traveler's hostel, we welcome those coming to/from San Francisco as temporary tourists. We unfortunately are unable to host residents of the Bay Area.  We have multiple listings on Airbnb for the same hostel simply so that we may accept more than one guest at a time.  Search \"Friendly Hostel with Community\" to find them.  All of our \"Friendly Hostel with Community\" listings are for Pacific Tradewinds Hostel and are exactly the same (same hostel, same price, same rooms, etc).   </td><td>Public transportation is plentiful and nearby, though many things are walking distance. We are next to the #1 bus, 1 block from the California Cable Car line, and 5 blocks from the Montgomery BART station. You can catch many other buses near the BART station as well.  Cars are not recommended since we are right in downtown SF and parking garages are very expensive (about $30/24 hours). There is minimal street parking in front of the hostel: 7pm-7am during the week, and limited on the weekends. Alternatively, we know of some first come, first served free street parking across the city. You can then take a 25 minute bus ride back.</td><td>Guests have 24/7 access to their dorm, the shared bathrooms, the kitchen, and the common area. Please no cooking between midnight and 6am.</td><td>Reception is available to answer any and all questions between 8am and midnight. Reception is closed from midnight to 8am, though there is always someone on site in case of emergency.</td><td>Check in is available from 8am-midnight each day.  As a travelers house, all guests are required to have a government issued photo ID and proof of traveling status (i.e. plane tickets or passport).   You will be asked for a $20 refundable security deposit at check-in.    Most of our rules are common sense and will be explained at check-in.   In general, we simply ask that guests follow the golden rule of living in community:  \"Be Excellent to One Another\".   If you have any questions, please message me.</td><td></td><td></td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/2220270/fb81b9c8_original.jpg?aki_policy=large</td><td></td><td>329072</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/329072</td><td>Darren & Friends</td><td>2010-12-28</td><td>San Anselmo, California, United States</td><td></td><td>within an hour</td><td>91%</td><td>N/A</td><td>f</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/329072/profile_pic/1293574350/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/329072/profile_pic/1293574350/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Chinatown</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']</td><td>t</td><td>f</td><td>San Francisco, CA, United States</td><td>Financial District</td><td>Financial District</td><td></td><td>San Francisco</td><td>CA</td><td>94111</td><td>San Francisco</td><td>San Francisco, CA</td><td>US</td><td>United States</td><td>37.79309</td><td>-122.40443</td><td>t</td><td>Hostel</td><td>Shared room</td><td>2</td><td>1.0</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>Real Bed</td><td>{Internet,Wifi,Kitchen,\"Paid parking off premises\",Heating,Washer,Dryer,\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"First aid kit\",Essentials,Shampoo,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49\",\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50\",\"Hot water\",Microwave,\"Coffee maker\",\"Dishes and silverware\",\"Host greets you\"}</td><td></td><td>$45.00</td><td>$329.00</td><td></td><td>$0.00</td><td>$0.00</td><td>1</td><td>$45.00</td><td>1</td><td>14</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>1.0</td><td>14.0</td><td>2 weeks ago</td><td>t</td><td>4</td><td>14</td><td>43</td><td>43</td><td>2019-10-14</td><td>395</td><td>64</td><td>2011-03-28</td><td>2019-09-20</td><td>94</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>t</td><td>428539.0</td><td>{\"SAN FRANCISCO\"}</td><td>t</td><td>f</td><td>flexible</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>20</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>20</td><td>3.79</td></tr><tr><td>72921</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/72921</td><td>20191014170858</td><td>2019-10-14</td><td>Wonderful private 1 bedroom apt.

Our neighborhood has little traffic, is quiet with charming alleyways and a nice park (Glen Park) a few blocks away. We say it is like living in the suburbs but still has all the benefits of living in a city. The neighborhood is hilly (this is San Francisco after all) but very walkable with Glen Park, food markets, shops and restaurants all within walking distance. In the summer, we often have sunny days when other parts of the city are fogged in.</td><td>Kitchenette amenities include; small refrigerator with freezer, large toaster oven (convection and broil), hot plate, coffee pot, microwave, tea kettle, silverware, plates, bowls, and cups. Although the kitchenette does not have a sink, our guests use the bathroom sink to wash dishes. All bedding, towels, cleaning supplies and laundry detergent are included as well as an iron, ironing board, and hairdryer.  We have one small (9 lbs.) dog, Paco. He stays upstairs with us, but you will likely meet him when you check in and are welcome to play with him in the yard if you would like. See our listing photos to see him. We have a dog walker (Jake) who picks him up each morning so don’t be alarmed if you see him coming and going with Paco.  STR (Phone number hidden by Airbnb)</td><td>Public transportation - BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) is .5 mile from our home. There are also many (MUNI) buses going to and from our neighborhood, but we prefer the BART subway trains because they are much faster.  There is always free street parking available right in front of our home, and a parking sticker is NOT required (a rare thing in San Francisco). The only parking restrictions are the 2nd & 4th Tuesday & Friday 9 – 11am for street cleaning. Tuesday’s, the East side of the street, Friday’s the West. There is signage on the street to remind you.</td><td>The studio is on the ground floor of our home, we live upstairs. The bottom floor basement leads out to a large backyard. Although the studio is private and separate from our living area, you’ll have access to the following shared amenities: backyard, deck and washer& dryer. The entrance to the home is also shared. Check-in time is 3pm (we'll coordinate approximate arrival time with you). We want your check-in to be a pleasant experience and will do our best to be home to check you in. However, we are both busy working professionals so may not be home when you arrive.  We’ll come down to check you in if we are home. If we are not home, the keys will be in a large Master Lock case (the kind Real Estate agents use) hooked to the front gate.</td><td>We'll do our best to be home when upon arrival to check guests in. We're always happy to give recommendations on local spots (check out our guidebook)! Otherwise, we don't usually see our guests much. The studio is on a separate floor than our living area and very private.</td><td>Quiet time is 10:30pm – 6:00am. Please don't do laundry during quite time! We will respect your privacy at all times, but reserve the right to enter the studio at anytime.  No cigarette smoking, please! When coming and going, please close the front (iron) gate, front door and door to the studio quietly (we do our best to be quiet when coming in going as well).

We are within walking distance of several grocery stores, post office, parks, restaurants, and shopping.

Everyone has a personal key to their bedrooms and may admit other housemates at their discretion.</td><td>I live in the house and am around most of the time to help out. Just holler if you need anything!  I provide cleaning to the main areas of the house (excluding guests dishes and rooms). I am also available to offer information about San Francisco to new comers of the city. I also schedule regular house events (Sunday dinners, hikes, ect).</td><td>HOUSE RULES Living in community is very different than living alone or with a family.\tYou must always be kind and respectful to other housemates and behave in a way that is not a burden to your fellow housemates.  You might need to modify your normal routines for the benefit of the community.  You should not only be willing to clean up after yourself but be willing to do a little extra to help a housemate or the community.   This is a sample of some of the house rules.   A complete list of house rules will need to be agreed to prior to move in. 1.   STUDENTS ONLY - This home is intended for short term accommodation for visiting students only.   You must maintain your student, intern or educational work exchange status to stay here. 2.  FRIENDLY COMMUNITY - You should always be friendly & respectful to others, the house and the neighborhood.   Even if you perceive someone is not being respectful to you.   3. NOISE – You must always be mindful of noise that may disturb other housemates o</td><td></td><td></td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/740761/e08fa90d_original.jpg?aki_policy=large</td><td></td><td>576273</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/576273</td><td>Shelli</td><td>2011-05-10</td><td>San Anselmo, California, United States</td><td>Hi!

The 24 Divisadero also goes along Castro (Castro turns into Divisadero going North) which will take you to the lower Height, hopping NOPA and all the way over to chic Pacific Heigths and then down to the Marina towards Chrissy Field.  Walking is always recommended though cause you will get a nice work out and really take things in!</td><td></td><td></td><td>Being that this is a sanctuary, it's customary to behave in a calm and peaceful manner.

A complete list of house rules will need to be agreed to prior to move in. 1.   STUDENTS ONLY - This home is intended for short term accommodation for visiting students only.   You must maintain your student, intern or educational work exchange status to stay here. 2.

As a traveler's hostel, we welcome those coming to/from San Francisco as temporary tourists. We unfortunately are unable to host residents of the Bay Area.  DATES NOT AVAILABLE?

We have multiple listings on Airbnb for the same hostel simply so that we may accept more than one guest at a time.  Search \"Friendly Hostel with Community\" to find them.  All of our \"Friendly Hostel with Community\" listings are for Pacific Tradewinds Hostel and are exactly the same (same hostel, same price, same rooms, etc).   Please note that occasionally the Airbnb calendar will show space is available when it is not, due to our calendars not aligning. You can always message us first to ask.</td><td>Public transportation is plentiful and nearby, though many things are walking distance. We are next to the #1 bus, 1 block from the California Cable Car line, and 5 blocks from the Montgomery BART station. You can catch many other buses near the BART station as well.  Cars are not recommended since we are right in downtown SF and parking garages are very expensive (about $30/24 hours). There is minimal street parking in front of the hostel: 7pm-7am during the week, and limited on the weekends. Alternatively, we know of some first come, first served free street parking across the city. You can then take a 25 minute bus ride back.</td><td>Guests have 24/7 access to their dorm, the shared bathrooms, the kitchen, and the common area. Please no cooking between midnight and 6am.</td><td>Reception is available to answer any and all questions between 8am and midnight. Reception is closed from midnight to 8am, though there is always some on site in case of emergency.</td><td>Check in is available from 8am-midnight each day.  As a travelers house, all guests are required to have a government issued photo ID and proof of traveling status (i.e. plane tickets or passport).   You will be asked for a $20 refundable security deposit at check-in.    Most of our rules are common sense and will be explained at check-in.   In general, we simply ask that guests follow the golden rule of living in community:  \"Be Excellent to One Another\".

         "House Rule footnotes: 1.\tI don’t allow check in before 9:00 on the first day of your reservation. I offer ‘early arrival’ from 9:01 to 18:59 for $20 per group of people that arrive together. The ‘early arrival’ fee is triggered by the following behavior: arriving during the early arrival time frame, scheduling an arrival during the early arrival time frame, asking if you may arrive during the early arrival time frame or hinting that you will or want to arrive during the early arrival time frame. Each scenario consumes my time, thus the charge. Since even asking if you can arrive early costs money, please don’t ask. I always allow early arrival for a fee, so please just tell me when you will arrive during the early arrival time frame. Late arrival is from 21:00 to 23:59 and the price and terms are the same as early arrival. This means you should not ask if you can arrive late, because I always allow it for a fee. If you simply ask, that triggers the fee, because asking consumes my time ",

         "During the hours of 7:00 to 22:00, your access to the living room, dining area and kitchen is conditioned on you overlooking any dirt, messiness or untidiness you discover. The living room, dining area and living room are closed from 22:00 to 7:00. I am not required to share the public areas of my home, and can easily uncheck the access boxes inside Airbnb's software that permit access. I clean the public areas nearly constantly and I really try to keep the place clean, but keeping up with thousands of guests is challenging. This policy means you may never leave a review that complains about the public areas of my house being dirty, because if you do then you are admitting you failed to uphold your end of our agreement which is for you to overlook any mess or disarray in the public areas. At best, I will vacuum the common areas one time per day, so you will see dust balls and dog hair here, as I have an active dog playing with guests and my family for hours daily.

         "I live at the house in my own bedroom, and I work from home, so I am around to answer questions and help you make the most of your visit. When you arrive, I will offer you a free map of San Francisco. I will also suggest we sit at the dining room table to discuss what you want to do while in the City. I will point out on the map the places you mention. I will also suggest other places you may not have heard of or considered.  Many of my guests later write in their reviews how much value they obtained from this conversation. Lots of hosts on airbnb don't spend the time to help their guests make the most of their visit. I love helping out my guests, and you'll sense my enthusiasm when we meet. I love San Francisco and I'll help you love San Francisco too. I am not like the concierge at a fancy hotel. I don't collect commissions from any of the places I recommend.",
         "Airbnb has no default house rules that hosts can use. Every host must write their own rules. A host without rules can’t enforce any common sense on guests, because Airbnb requires there be a written rule to enforce. Why should you care? Imagine you book a room at a shared house and a guest gets roaring drunk and starts screaming. Unless there is a house rule prohibiting that, Airbnb will allow it to continue, and the host is powerless to require the guest to quiet down or depart. Since my rules are long, I have summarized them up front, and then elaborated in the footnotes. To understand all of the rules, you’ll have to read the summary and the footnotes. To get the general idea, you only need to read the summary. Please don't let them intimidate you, because it's these rules that allow me to ensure my guests will have a great experience at my busy shared home.

         "We live in a dense, urban neighborhood, and our home is 100 years old, with creaky stairs and floors, and very little sound insulation. There are neighbors all around, including directly above, so you'll likely hear footsteps, dogs barking, babies crying, sirens, and all manner of \"city\" and \"roommate\" noises. It's peaceful, and we try to stay reasonably quiet until guests awake, but if you seek complete tranquility, then our home might not be the right fit. That said, only about 1% of our hundreds of previous guests have mentioned noise as an issue.  We like to know a bit about our guests, so please complete your Airbnb Profile before you book.  We need to be home to greet our guests in person, and cannot always accommodate late arrivals. If you plan to arrive later than 10:00 PM, please ask BEFORE booking.

Everywhere!  Our neighborhood is great for bicycling: Flat, with dedicated bike lanes on both Valencia Street and 17th Street. And we're both avid riders, and love to share the city's cycling secrets. (Trust us: You want to know about the Wiggle before you set off to Golden Gate Park.)  The 101 and 280 freeways are also nearby, but parking in our neighborhood is tough. (The Mission-Bartlett Parking Garage is three blocks away, ~$30/day.)",

Any day of the week, the Upper Haight is filled with a potent mix of locals and tourists. Many shops are geared towards luring visitors with some kind of reflection of the neighborhood's storied past. The carnival-like energy and strong vintage atmosphere comes through everywhere, from the clothing shops to the ornate Victorian architecture. Less touristy and more low-key than the Upper Haight, this is an eclectic alternative to the Mission, very similar in style. The diverse restaurants, shops and salons cater to residents more than visitors. Walking distance to tennis courts located in a beautiful park. The park is also great for jogging and evening walks.

Unlike some other parts of San Francisco, Hayes Valley has managed to retain a sense of community and a nonexclusive feel despite the fast build-up and high price tags. Some of the businesses that braved the less-than-savory days are still around, such as the Hayes Street Grill, now twice its original size. But many of the shops sprouted up in the '90s, making Hayes Valley a real destination spot. The combination results in a wide diversity in clientele. While high-end San Franciscans sip $7 cocktails at Absinthe, down the street many are powering down an entire meal for around the same price at Flipper's. Now, tourists also head here specifically for the shopping, for one-of-a-kinds like a buffalo-leather chair or an exclusive Sue Wong Art Deco gown. The Hayes Valley commercial sector is young in age, but adult in style. As a destination, it serves theater and symphony patrons as we",

         "Potrero Hill is the sunniest neighborhood in San Francisco! In the summertime, when much of the city is covered in chilly fog, our neighborhood usually has sunshine. We are walking distance from the new Chase Center (home to major music performances and Golden State Warriors basketball) and about a mile from Oracle Park (home to  Giants baseball) The neighborhood has great views and it's very quiet but, yet, you can quickly get downtown or to the trendy (but rowdy) Mission District. We have an assortment of great local restaurants within walking distance (we provide restaurant menus and a map), and you can even organize a tour of San Francisco's most famous historic brewery, Anchor Steam, which is a few blocks away. There are 2 markets and a great little organic grocery store within an easy walk. We have a wonderful bookstore, independent coffee houses and cute shops on the main business street in the neighborhood. See photos of them in the photo section of our listing.",
         "SAN FRANCISCO TIPS: --Bring a jacket, no matter what time of year you are visiting. It always cools down at night here, and can also be breezy. A leather jacket is perfect! --We recommend using the car services Uber and Lyft. They are much less expensive than taxis and more efficient than public transportation. We can give you codes for discounts.  --You might consider renting a car for at least part of your stay in San Francisco. Our neighborhood is well-served by mass transit, but some of the worthwhile attractions (such as the deYoung Museum) are far from the downtown, Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf areas. You might also want to take a day-trip up to the Wine Country or Muir Woods (parking reservation required), which are north of the city. --If you are parking a car in San Francisco, always turn the wheels so the car can't roll on a hill. If the car is pointed UPHILL, turn the wheels AWAY from the curb. If the car is pointed DOWNHILL, turn the wheels TOWARD the curb. --If you a",
         "We are served by 2 bus lines and 1 tram line. The #22 bus, which goes to the Mission District, Pacific Heights and the Marina District, stops 1 block from our house. The #10 bus, which goes downtown, near Union Square, the Financial District, and Pacific Heights, stops 3 blocks from our house. The \"T\" tram is about a 10-minute walk from our house, and it goes downtown, to the baseball stadium, to the waterfront, and connects with other transportation that will take you anywhere in the city, including Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. The #22 bus and the \"T\" tram also connect with the BART transportation system, which goes to the airport. By taxi, our house is about 15 minutes from the San Francisco Airport. Lyft or Uber is also an excellent option for getting around town and our recommended way to get here from the airport. If you aren't a member of these car services, we can provide you with a coupon code for a discount on your first ride. Just ask! There is also a bike-share docking sta",

         "After hosting more than 300 times, we understand that guests have very different needs. Some like a lot of advice and interaction, while others like to be independent.

We listen to our guests’ recommendations and continue to improve the flat to meet our visitor’s needs.  We think of you as family.\r\n\r\nMe? \r\n\r\nUniversity of Connecticut (UCONN) for learning, NYC for youthful playing and California for career, work and residing.\r\n\r\nMusic, theater, traveling and gardening are some of my passions.\r\n\r\nA dog named Rocky is my most loyal and steady companion.\r\n\r\nFavorite quotes are the ones related to the theme of 'repeating history.’\r\n\r\nMy Love of travel has led me to rediscover walking, (even between countries or small cities), like the walk to Santiago de Compostela from France to Northern Spain.  It is a different way to explore a country and its people.   It is great to venture into all the places that make a city or neighborhood alive.   However, make sure you have Siri with you, just in case, you get too lost! \r\n\r\nThe city?\r\n\r\nSan Francisco is the most European of all cities in the United States. \r\nI’m sure you will enjoy it as much as I have for the past 30+ years.  \r\n\r\nA city is only as dynamic as its people, and the tech revolution with its infusion of young adults have positively influenced San Francisco in wondrous ways.  For example, biking lanes in San Francisco have more than doubled since 2006 with protected bike lanes and closure of major portions of Market Street to allow for bike and public transportation traffic.  Plans are on the way to complete the San Francisco-to-Oakland Bay Bridge path way - it now reaches Yerba Buena Island. \r\n\r\nRestaurants and cafes?

         "Located between Valencia Street and Dolores Park, our home is in an ideal location for exploring the Mission, as well as the rest of San Francisco. It's an easy walk to the Castro, Haight Street, Hayes Valley, and Noe Valley. And we're close to BART and Muni, so it's easy to visit the Ferry Building, Union Square, Downtown... Everywhere!  Then again, you might not want to leave the neighborhood at all... Here's a very incomplete list of spots within a few blocks of our home: Foodie Heaven: Tartine, Delfina, Bi Rite Market and Creamery, Mission Chinese Food, Lolo, Locanda, Foreign Cinema, Smitten, the list goes on - and seems to grow daily!  Shopping: 826 Valencia (Dave Eggers' Pirate Supply Store!), Paxton Gate, Curiosities for Kids, Beta Brand, Mission Bicycle, Self Edge, Blue Dot Furniture, Weston Wear, Shoe Biz... Dolores Park, the Chapel and Amnesia (for live music), Clarion Alley (home to the CAMP Mural project), the Women's Building (maybe the most famous of the famous Mission Mu",
         "Our home is 100 years old, and has creaky stairs and floors, and very little sound insulation. With neighbors directly above, right and left, you might hear footsteps, dogs barking, babies crying, any manner of \"city\" and/or \"roommate\" noise. It's peaceful, and we try to stay reasonably quiet until guests awake, but if you seek complete tranquility, then our home might not be the right fit. That said, only about 1% of our hundreds of previous guests have mentioned noise as an issue.  We like to know a bit about our guests, so please complete your Airbnb Profile before attempting to book.  If you plan to arrive later than 10:00 PM, please let us know BEFORE booking. If you book first, and then tell us about your late arrival, we'll request a $50 Late Check In Fee.  Please check your total price before booking. Our pricing varies, and can be higher on weekends and during \"high\" season, and there's also a cleaning fee, and a sur-charge for extra guests.  We do not offer discounts for long",
         "It's an easy and lovely 10 minute stroll to the 16th St/Mission BART Station, and there are Muni Routes all around us, so there's easy access to SFO, Union Square, Moscone Center, Market Street, the Ferry Building, Golden Gate Park, AT&T Park... Everywhere!  Our neighborhood is great for bicycling, too: Flat, with dedicated bike lanes on both Valencia Street and 17th Street. And we're both avid riders, and love to share the city's cycling secrets. (Trust us: You want to know about the Wiggle before you set off to Golden Gate Park.)  The 101 and 280 freeways are also nearby, but parking in our neighborhood is tough. (There is a parking garage three blocks away, ~$25/day.)",
         "Guests have their own suite, with a large bedroom / sitting area, \"en-suite\" bathroom, and exclusive use of the garden. Access to the suite is through the house, and down a flight of stairs. The stairs are old, steep, and narrow. Please take a look at the photos in our listing, and make sure the stairs won't be any trouble.  You will most likely be sharing the \"Common\" areas in our home with a \"Guest Host\" who'll be filling in for Wendy and I, and there may also be another room of Airbnb guests, too. Common areas include the living room and sunporch, as well as the kitchen, which may be used for storing and re-heating food and making light \"snacks\" but not for cooking full meals. Please, no real cooking without prior permission. (With all the amazing restaurants nearby, who wants to cook???)",
         "This is usually our own bedroom, so if it's available, it might be because we're away. If we are both away, you will be sharing our home with a \"Guest Host\" - someone who'll be around to ensure your comfort, and to happily point you toward the traditional tourist sites or the hidden hotspots, whatever your preference. There may also be another room of Airbnb Guests, upstairs, in our Mission Sunshine listing. Guest interaction covers the full range, from sharing dinner or drinks, to rarely seeing each other. It all depends on preferences and schedules.",
         "PLEASE READ: By booking, you agree to all of the following rules. If there are too many rules for you to read through, please consider another listing! (These rules have evolved over our 10+ years of hosting on Airbnb, and they are here to make you aware of situations or issues that you might not like, and to keep you from booking a spot you may not enjoy.) CHECK-IN: You do NOT have a check-in time yet. YOU MUST COORDINATE YOUR CHECK-IN WITH US! After booking, please SEND A MESSAGE WITH YOUR ARRIVAL TIME. That way, we can try to coordinate your check-in time as best we can. (We do not have a lock-box, so we must be here to meet you in person for check in. We will try to accommodate your preferred arrival time. The sooner you schedule your arrival time with us, the more likely it will be that we can accommodate your timing, but you do not have a guaranteed arrival time until you have coordinated it with us.)

         "Frequently Asked Questions 1. Is the rental noisy? We are in the city, so city life happens. The rental has double glazed windows and insulated walls to cut down on noise, and it does help. Noise tolerance is very personal and highly subjective to the individual’s comfort zone. Most of our guests do not have a problem with street noise, even babies and toddlers have slept soundly throughout the night! If you are a very light sleeper or highly sensitive to any noise, then this is not the right place for you. 2. Why do you charge an extra $80 cleaning fee? The cleaning fee is a one-time charge to clean the rental after you check out. It is a fair market rate by San Francisco standard. We take pride in delivering a clean, sanitized and comfortable space to every guest staying with us. We don’t scrimp on quality; you get what you pay for. 3. Why do I need to sign a rental agreement with you? The rental agreement is a standard document that I require all my guests to acknowledge and sign, s",

(This definition includes the entire Lower Haight within Hayes Valley.)

         "Rental Cars and Parking Most locals and frequent visitors to San Francisco (SF) would recommend against renting a car or getting to SF using their own car.  This is because parking in the city is expensive and at times, hard to find.  Overnight parking in the city may cost a visitor $30 to $50 per night and in some cases without in/out privileges.  Parking near most of the tourist areas, may cost the visitor about $12 to $15 dollars an hour in a parking lot.   Parking spots along the road are hard to find and if one does, they are all metered every day of the week in the visitor areas. Parking outside the visitor areas is timed for visitors who do not have a parking permit.  And a parking ticket in San Francisco starts at $86 for the fine. Even if one finds an empty parking spot, visitors have to check to see if parking is allowed at that time.  There are street cleaning times, rush hour periods when parking is not allowed. Parking fines/tickets or the car being towed is the last thing",
         "The area is served by several San Francisco Municipal Railway (MUNI) bus lines and it is a few blocks away from all of the MUNI Metro lines. The heart of the neighborhood, at the corner of Fillmore and Haight, is six blocks away from the subway stop of Church and Market, which is also the location of the city's largest supermarket, a Safeway. Surveys show that this neighborhood has one of the highest number of daily trips by bike per capita of any San Francisco neighborhood[citation needed], and walking is also very popular. The geography of the Lower Haight lends itself to the most efficient bicycle routing from the Mission District towards Golden Gate Park and surrounding neighborhoods, and the popular bicycle route termed The Wiggle zig zags through this neighborhood.",

Muni Bus system: If you intend to ride the cable cars, then it is cheaper to buy a bus pass, the bus fares are $2.75 and the cable cars are $7 so it’s better value to get a bus pass.

Passports may be purchased on the Muni website or at the Airport, SFO Information Booth (Baggage Claim area) For more information on Muni Passports, see the Muni website. • 1-day Passport $17 • 3-day Passport $26 • 7-day Passport $35 The cheapest way to get to the apartment from SFO is a door to door Super Shuttle, it costs about $19 per person one way, if there are 3 or more people then a Taxi is cheaper, about $45. ZIPCARS: There is a Zip Car location one block from the apartment, they rent cars by the hour and by the day, please visit the ZIPCAR website for more information.

I am delighted that such a format exists!!\n\nUpdate:  Wow, it is almost 9 years since I joined airbnb.  As an airbnb host during those near 9 years, I have met incredible and amazing people including not so nice individuals.  Also, as an airbnb guest, I have travelled and experienced different cultures, ate various cuisines reflective of people's culture, and saw the world through the prism of a foreigner.  As a result, my life is so much richer and am looking forward to the next 7 years and beyond with hopes of meeting more wonderful guests, traveling to other destinations, and enriching every layer of my life.\n\nBy the way, I am also now a hobbyist beekeeper.  I can't wait for this next adventure to unfold!!!\n\n-Maria",

Unlike a hostel, the rooms have a desk, drawers an space to spread out, decorate, and make your temporary home feel comfortable. Housemates enjoy a free high speed internet Wi-Fi, a fully equipped kitchen, private bathrooms and laundry facilities. There's also a community common lounge with comfy sofas, chairs and community desks. Many of us also usually chip in and enjoy one weekly community meal together. We offer flexible and affordable monthly rates. This is month-to-month rental accommodation so a housemate request application and credit check is required.

You might need to modify your normal routines for the benefit of the community.  You should not only be willing to clean up after yourself but be willing to do a little extra to help a housemate or the community.   This is a sample of some of the house rules.   A complete list of house rules will need to be agreed to prior to move in. 1.   STUDENTS ONLY - This home is intended for short term accommodation for visiting students only.   You must maintain your student, intern or educational work exchange status to stay here. 2.  FRIENDLY COMMUNITY - You should always be friendly & respectful to others, the house and the neighborhood.   Even if you perceive someone is not being respectful to you.   3.

If you realize that you will be arriving after midnight, you MUST contact us by telephone by 5pm to see if we have someone to let you in after midnight. If we can accommodate your late arrival, there will be a $15 late check-in fee applied. Please note that even if you do call by 5pm, we CAN NOT guarantee that we will be able to accommodate the late check in.  As a traveler's hostel, we welcome those coming to/from San Francisco as temporary tourists. We unfortunately are unable to host residents of the Bay Area.  We have multiple listings on Airbnb for the same hostel simply so that we may accept more than one guest at a time.  Search \"Friendly Hostel with Community\" to find them.  All of our \"Friendly Hostel with Community\" listings are for Pacific Tradewinds Hostel and are exactly the same (same hostel, same price, same rooms, etc).   ",

Cars are not recommended since we are right in downtown SF and parking garages are very expensive (about $30/24 hours). There is minimal street parking in front of the hostel: 7pm-7am during the week, and limited on the weekends. Alternatively, we know of some first come, first served free street parking across the city. You can then take a 25 minute bus ride back.",

         "We live in the Glen Park neighborhood of San Francisco, the location is ideally situated for access to both downtown San Francisco and points south such as Silicon Valley. Our neighborhood has little traffic, is quiet with charming alleyways and a nice park (Glen Park) a few blocks away. We say it is like living in the suburbs but still has all the benefits of living in a city. The neighborhood is hilly (this is San Francisco after all) but very walkable with Glen Park, food markets, shops and restaurants all within walking distance. In the summer, we often have sunny days when other parts of the city are fogged in.",
         "Kitchenette amenities include; small refrigerator with freezer, large toaster oven (convection and broil), hot plate, coffee pot, microwave, tea kettle, silverware, plates, bowls, and cups. Although the kitchenette does not have a sink, our guests use the bathroom sink to wash dishes. All bedding, towels, cleaning supplies and laundry detergent are included as well as an iron, ironing board, and hairdryer.  We have one small (9 lbs.) dog, Paco. He stays upstairs with us, but you will likely meet him when you check in and are welcome to play with him in the yard if you would like. See our listing photos to see him. We have a dog walker (Jake) who picks him up each morning so don’t be alarmed if you see him coming and going with Paco.  STR (Phone number hidden by Airbnb)",
         "Public transportation - BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) is .5 mile from our home. There are also many (MUNI) buses going to and from our neighborhood, but we prefer the BART subway trains because they are much faster.  There is always free street parking available right in front of our home, and a parking sticker is NOT required (a rare thing in San Francisco). The only parking restrictions are the 2nd & 4th Tuesday & Friday 9 – 11am for street cleaning. Tuesday’s, the East side of the street, Friday’s the West. There is signage on the street to remind you.",
         "The studio is on the ground floor of our home, we live upstairs. The bottom floor basement leads out to a large backyard. Although the studio is private and separate from our living area, you’ll have access to the following shared amenities: backyard, deck and washer& dryer. The entrance to the home is also shared. Check-in time is 3pm (we'll coordinate approximate arrival time with you). We want your check-in to be a pleasant experience and will do our best to be home to check you in. However, we are both busy working professionals so may not be home when you arrive.  We’ll come down to check you in if we are home. If we are not home, the keys will be in a large Master Lock case (the kind Real Estate agents use) hooked to the front gate.",

No cigarette smoking, please! When coming and going, please close the front (iron) gate, front door and door to the studio quietly (we do our best to be quiet when coming in going as well).

As an airbnb host during those near 9 years, I have met incredible and amazing people including not so nice individuals.  Also, as an airbnb guest, I have travelled and experienced different cultures, ate various cuisines reflective of people's culture, and saw the world through the prism of a foreigner.  As a result, my life is so much richer and am looking forward to the next 7 years and beyond with hopes of meeting more wonderful guests, traveling to other destinations, and enriching every layer of my life.\n\nBy the way, I am also now a hobbyist beekeeper.

         "Seb and I have been hosting guests on Airbnb since 2010. We have a 3 year old baby.  I work as a psychologist with kids and spend weekends working in my garden, cooking, relaxing around the neighborhood. I have lived in the Mission for last 18 years and love talking about the neighborhood, world travels and good places to eat. I have lived abroad in East Africa and traveled in Europe and Central/South America. I love learning about new places to visit, especially coastal spots and warm spots, and trying new foods.  Our profile pictures are shots of us traveling in Mexico, Spain, France and Armenia.\r\n\r\nWe live in this apartment too, so you will see us hanging out in the kitchen and common areas.  Our bedroom is towards the back of the house, while the three guest rooms are in the front of the house.  I try to balance visiting with guests and having alone time.  The house tends to be pretty quiet and mellow. We specifically do not rent to couples so that there are a max of three guests at any time.\r\nSebouh lives downstairs and you will see him occasionally. He speaks fluent Armenian and is a plumber and works out of our house, so he comes and goes throughout the day. ",

I am delighted that such a format exists!!\n\nUpdate:  Wow, it is almost 9 years since I joined airbnb.  As an airbnb host during those near 9 years, I have met incredible and amazing people including not so nice individuals.  Also, as an airbnb guest, I have travelled and experienced different cultures, ate various cuisines reflective of people's culture, and saw the world through the prism of a foreigner.  As a result, my life is so much richer and am looking forward to the next 7 years and beyond with hopes of meeting more wonderful guests, traveling to other destinations, and enriching every layer of my life.\n\nBy the way, I am also now a hobbyist beekeeper.  I can't wait for this next adventure to unfold!!!\n\n-Maria",

Unlike a hostel, the rooms have a desk, drawers an space to spread out, decorate, and make your temporary home feel comfortable. Housemates enjoy a free high speed internet Wi-Fi, a fully equipped kitchen, private bathrooms and laundry facilities. There's also a community common lounge with comfy sofas, chairs and community desks. Many of us also usually chip in and enjoy one weekly community meal together. We offer flexible and affordable monthly rates. This is month-to-month rental accommodation so a housemate request application and credit check is required.

You might need to modify your normal routines for the benefit of the community.  You should not only be willing to clean up after yourself but be willing to do a little extra to help a housemate or the community.   This is a sample of some of the house rules.   A complete list of house rules will need to be agreed to prior to move in. 1.   STUDENTS ONLY - This home is intended for short term accommodation for visiting students only.   You must maintain your student, intern or educational work exchange status to stay here. 2.  FRIENDLY COMMUNITY - You should always be friendly & respectful to others, the house and the neighborhood.   Even if you perceive someone is not being respectful to you.   3.

The 24 Divisadero also goes along Castro (Castro turns into Divisadero going North) which will take you to the lower Height, hopping NOPA and all the way over to chic Pacific Heigths and then down to the Marina towards Chrissy Field.

As a single, gay man, my heart and home have been anchored in San Francisco since 2002, and there is nowhere else in the world I'd rather hang my hat. \r\n\nTravel and relocation have been prominent features of my life from an early age. Over the years I've lived in the Midwest and East Coast in the US as well as in Latin America, Western and Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. I was a university student in Spain, a Peace Corps volunteer in Paraguay, and a humanitarian aid worker in Bosnia, Serbia, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. \n\nI also dabble in vintage, salvage, and upcycled furniture, decor, and jewelry. My home features many objects & artifacts I've collected or repurposed over the years. One of my favorite pastimes is poking around sidewalk sales and thrift stores... but some of my treasures were just as likely found 'free online' or on the street corner. \r\n\r\nI'd love for you to come check out my place!

         "Single family home within walking distance to Golden Gate Park and all that it has to offer, including the Japanese Tea Garden, the DeYoung museum, and  the Academy of Sciences museum. 1 to 4 blocks away from many restaurants, markets, and coffee shops on Geary Blvd, including Peet's Coffee, Joe's Ice Cream, Gaspare's Pizza, Fiorella, Violet's, Pearl, a great wine shop, and a great food market. Also about 2 blocks away from a great park, and about 6 minutes drive to the Golden Gate Bridge. You get the idea - centrally located. Perfect for a family of 4 or 5. The house is a beautiful, 1915 Edwardian with Craftsman elements. Great for families with kids. Backyard with barbeque and a newer trampoline. Open, gourmet kitchen (fully stocked - my wife is a trained cook). Beautiful living room with working fireplace, and formal dining room.

         "Potrero Hill is one of San Francisco's hidden gems. We have great weather, lovely views and feel like a small town within the Big City. Except we have numerous wonderful restaurants and cafes within walking distance. My Guidebook lists many of them and I'll provide you a detailed list in your room.",
         "For safety reasons, I do not include a photo of the my house exterior here. After a confirmed booking, I will provide a confirmation message via your Airbnb email, including transport options and a picture of the house for reference.",
         "Public transit is just one block away. You'll have choices re: buses or light rail to go just about anyplace in the City. Glad to provide my insights and/or check online resources for you.",
         "Your stay includes daytime use of lush gardens in the front & back. The one in front is great in the afternoon sun. You have an updated private bath with tiled shower and free access to laundry facilities. You are welcome to use the kitchen including tea kettle, fridge, microwave, table etc. for breakfast or snacks. Use of the stove is not included. I keep the living room private although you are welcome to walk through to access the rear garden.",
         "This setting is best for other friendly humans. Since I'm retired, I'm around a lot, although I do keep pretty busy. I'm a friendly soul, glad to talk about your visit, offer ideas & assistance, and learn about your life.  I am also respectful of your privacy.  Olive can be a little shy; please don't take it personally if she hides a lot while you are here.",
         "I have some flexibility re: check in and check out. Just ask. Check out is generally by 12 pm. Parking is quite easy near the Haven, unlike many places in SF. On my block, we do have 2 hour limits weekdays between 10 & 4. Unlimited free parking is available just around the corner and right in front at night & on the weekends. Shoes: please remove hard soled shoes such as boots inside the flat. Cat awareness:  Please watch out for Olive at the doors, she is not allowed outside.  Please know I am an early riser. I make every effort to be quiet while making breakfast.  And, be aware I may be up and moving around before the sun. I provide a personal copy of a SF visitors' map (to keep if you wish). An additional SF Guidebook & map library is available for your enjoyment. Please maintain & return them for future guests. I provide all linens including towels.  Privacy: guests will not enter Nancy's personal spaces w/o invitation. Nancy will enter guest space only for housekeeping: to empty t",

I now spend my time in the garden, painting, traveling, maintaining body and spirit, and making my Urban Haven ready for the next guest. \r\n\r\nSince 1975, I've been renovating my 1889 era SF Victorian. It is now complete. I am excited to share my space, wonderful city and neighborhood with Airbnb travelers.  I am early to bed and early to rise. Seeking congenial quiet guests who would appreciate this sweet setting.\r\n\r\nI speak some French, Spanish and Italian. Enjoy practicing with my guests.\r\n\r\nYou can see more about me online by searching for nancenotes.\r\n\r\nSince my first wonderful experience as an Airbnb traveler in Puerto Vallarta,  I've  now experienced fabulous Airbnb stays in the CA Wine Country, Mexico, plus the UK and Denmark inspired by wonderful Airbnb guests in my place.  I look forward to meeting you one way or another.\r\n\r\nA final note: I only take 2-3 reservations a month. So if the Haven appeals to you, suggest you reserve early.",

         "Our location can't be beat! We are located one block over from the famous San Francisco Chinatown, one block from the bustling Financial District, a few blocks south of \"Little Italy\" in North Beach, and just a 10 minute stroll from the water along the Embarcadero.",
         "Our dorms hold between 6 and 8 people. \"Four\" refers to our maximum group size, not the dorm size. As a traveler's hostel, we welcome those coming to/from San Francisco as temporary tourists. We unfortunately are unable to host residents of the Bay Area.  DATES NOT AVAILABLE? Check one of our other listings!  MORE GUESTS IN YOUR GROUP? Our other listings can accommodate more guests!  We have multiple listings on Airbnb for the same hostel simply so that we may accept more than one guest at a time.  Search \"Friendly Hostel with Community\" to find them.  All of our \"Friendly Hostel with Community\" listings are for Pacific Tradewinds Hostel and are exactly the same (same hostel, same price, same rooms, etc).   Please note that occasionally the Airbnb calendar will show space is available when it is not, due to our calendars not aligning. You can always message us first to ask.",
         "Public transportation is plentiful and nearby, though many things are walking distance. We are next to the #1 bus, 1 block from the California Cable Car line, and 5 blocks from the Montgomery BART station. You can catch many other buses near the BART station as well.  Cars are not recommended since we are right in downtown SF and parking garages are very expensive (about $30/24 hours). There is minimal street parking in front of the hostel: 7pm-7am during the week, and limited on the weekends. Alternatively, we know of some first come, first served free street parking across the city. You can then take a 25 minute bus ride back.",
         "Guests have 24/7 access to their dorm, the shared bathrooms, the kitchen, and the common area. Please no cooking between midnight and 6am.",
         "Reception is available to answer any and all questions between 8am and midnight. Reception is closed from midnight to 8am, though there is always some on site in case of emergency.",
         "Check in is available from 8am-midnight each day.  As a travelers house, all guests are required to have a government issued photo ID and proof of traveling status (i.e. plane tickets or passport).   You will be asked for a $20 refundable security deposit at check-in.    Most of our rules are common sense and will be explained at check-in.   In general, we simply ask that guests follow the golden rule of living in community:  \"Be Excellent to One Another\".   If you have any questions, please message me.",
